# Create images in markdown

## Image folder creation and link syntax

For a new article, you'll need to create a folder in the following location:

    /articles/<service-directory>/media/<article-name>/

For example:

    /articles/app-service/media/app-service-enterprise-multichannel-apps/

After you create the folder and added images to it, use the following syntax to create images in your article:

```
![Alt image text](./media/article-name/your-image-filename.png)
```
